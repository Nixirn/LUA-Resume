        "description": "The goal of the project is to make a cloud system that analyzes a live stream of data for 'Paychex, Inc'. The final system will take a variety of different data types from Kafka, a streaming platform, and abstract them to be analyzed using Microsoft Azure, a Microsoft cloud ecosystem."

        "description": "Wrote a webpage that demonstrates Dijkstra's algorithm with a few features. The user clicks on the screen to place walls on a grid of a set size. Once a wall is set, the algorithm will determine a path and show it on the screen with yellow squares. The path is calculated again with every wall placed by the user."

        "description": "Created a simulation for a University level physics lab in Unity. The lab itself deals with rotational dynamics and how torque affects angular acceleration. The purpose of this project was to create an alternative for students who can not attend in-person classes for any reason."
